## **What's Next?**

First congratulations! Please pat yourself on your back, you created
your first Wheels application. You can fix it up even more and
experiment. Also, you can look at the Litepost sample application since
you have the tables setup. Litepost is meant to compare different
frameworks using the same code base. Wheels is about community and
helping each other so say Hi on the CFWheels Google Group.
