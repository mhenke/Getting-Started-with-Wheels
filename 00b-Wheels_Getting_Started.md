 In this article Mike Henke will discuss ColdFusion On Wheels (Wheels).
Wheels is a ColdFusion framework inspired by Ruby On Rails. Wheels is
simple to use with the convention over configuration aspect. Wheels
doesn't turn using a ColdFusion framework into something different then
how you originally learned to code CFML. It is the only framework with
an integrated Object Relational Mapper to make interacting with your
database even simpler.

This article will be divided into four sections. The first section,
"What is Wheels?", is an introduction into Wheels philosophies like
simpilicty and convention over configuration. The second section,
"Creating a Wheels application", will show how to get up and running
with Wheels. We will also generate a simple application with a
scaffolding plugin. The third section, "Reviewing Generated Code", will
walk through the generated code. The fourth section, "Working with
Wheels", will customizing our application and add some functionality.
