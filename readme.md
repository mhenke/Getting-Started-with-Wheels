## Abstract

[ColdFusion On Wheels](http://cfwheels.org) is a powerful web application framework that has become popular in the past few years. It is relatively easy to develop with and can be used for awesome sites like [AmtrakGuestRewards.com](http://AmtrakGuestRewards.com), or cool ones like [Meritbuilder.com](http://Meritbuilder.com) and [Singsnap.com](http://Singsnap.com).

Getting Started with Rails

This guide covers getting up and running with Ruby on Rails. After reading it, you should be familiar with:

- Installing Rails, creating a new Rails application, and connecting your application to a database
- The general layout of a Wheels application
- The basic principles of MVC (Model, View Controller) and RESTful design
- How to quickly generate the starting pieces of a Wheels application.

## Wheels History

Rob Cameron founded the ColdFusion on Wheels project in 2005. He still blogs about ColdFusion, Rails, and open source software on his personal site, [Riding the Clutch](http://www.ridingtheclutch.com/). Following Rob, Per Djurner was the principal developer of ColdFusion on Wheels and helped lead the project to finishing the 1.0 and 1.1 releases. Now Anthony Petruzzi is the principal developer of the Wheels core team. He has a blog called [Rip's Domain](http://rip747.wordpress.com/).

Wheels approach is very different from other ColdFusion frameworks. Wheels was inspired by Ruby on Rails. Rails was extracted from the real world unlike other Java and Microsoft introduced frameworks. Rails and Wheels try to solve only the necessary problems and defer developing features until they are necessary. The simplicity approach is a big hit and has powered the growth of the Rails and Wheels communities ever since.
